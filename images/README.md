# Images Folder - Zoloti Maky

## Required Images

To complete the hero section, you need to add these two images to this folder:

- Save it as: `hero-background.jpg`
- Recommended size: 1920x1080 pixels or larger for best quality

### 2. **logo-white.png**
- This should be the circular logo with poppies (white/transparent version)
- Save it as: `logo-white.png`
- Make sure it has a transparent background (PNG format)
- Recommended: At least 800px wide for sharp display

1. Save your group photo as `hero-background.jpg`
2. Save your logo (white version) as `logo-white.png`
3. Place both files in this `/images` folder
4. Refresh your browser to see the changes!
